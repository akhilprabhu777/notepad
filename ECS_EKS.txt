ECS - 2 types of launching metheods
1) EC2 -- we need to launch ec2 machines, install docker and insatll ECS-agent etc manually
2) Fargate(serverless architecture) -- aws manages underlyning infra, creates ec2 machines on-demand

ECS has task definition(blueprint how conatiners should launch) file similar to docker-compose file which has all required details to run a conatiner Ex: CPU/memory, ports/image/volumes

ECS Service -- it ensures certain no.of tasks are running all time, restarts conatiner if crashes/exited

EKS -- aws manages the control plane
