command to login to openshift on command line --> oc login <cluster URL>
command to create a new project --> oc new-project name
oc project 21235 -- to go into 21235 namespace
oc explain pod --> to know how to create a pod yml file --  Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host
oc get pods/secrets/quota/route --> to list pods
oc rsh podname--> to start a shell in running pod
oc delete pod podname
oc describe pod podname

kubectl describe pod the-pod-name -- provides detailed information of a specific Pod and its containers
kubectl logs mypod --all-containers -- You can view the logs for all the containers of the pod:
kubectl logs mypod -c mycontainer -- even a container in that pod

livenessProbe
Indicates whether the container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy

readinessProbe
Indicates whether the container is ready to respond to requests. If the readiness probe fails, the container shouldnt receive traffic even if its running

----crashloopbackoff-------a container in the Pod is started, but crashes and is then restarted, over and over again.
restarting is because its restartPolicy is set to Always(by default) or OnFailure

Misconfigurations: Like a typo in a configuration file.
A resource is not available: Like a PersistentVolume that is not mounted.
Wrong command line arguments: Either missing, or the incorrect ones.
Bugs & Exceptions: That can be anything, very specific to your application.
Read-only filesystems, or lack of permissions in general.

-----imagepullerror---------
ErrImagePull is an error happening when the image specified for a container can’t be retrieved or pulled./ image indicated is not available or doesn’t exist.
ImagePullBackOff is the waiting grace period while the image pull is fixed/ Unlike CrashLoopBackOff, there are no restarts (technically Pod hasn’t even started)

A similar back-off period is ImagePullBackOff, which is a waiting status when a container image couldn’t be pulled.
A container image contains all the resources needed to run those processes: the binaries, libraries, and any necessary configuration.

Wrong image name/Wrong image tag/Wrong image digest
Network problem or image repo not available
Pulling from a private registry but not imagePullSecret was provided
