-----------Jenkins_Plugins--------- plugins are used for enhancing the functionality of jenkins env

greenballs plugin --> changes jenkins build to green color instead of blue for successful builds
Build Timeout plugin --> This plugin allows you to automatically terminate a build if it’s taking too long. This plugin isn’t applicable to pipelines.
Credentials Plugin --> This plugin allows you to store credentials in Jenkins
Multibranch Pipeline Plugin--> allows Jenkins to automatically build branches that contain jenkinsfile
CopyArtifact Plugin--> allows to copy artifatcs from previous built jobs 
Locable resource plugin --> to lock a particular job through agent for multiple builds
rebuild plugin, parameterized-trigger plugin, 


--------Diff b/w freestyle and pipeline jobs------
In freestyle job we use 2/3 jobs for build, test, deploy whereas in pipeline job we used stages to trigger all three in one go
Freestyle jobs are not durable(cannot resume builds when jenkins is restarted) and Pausable(approval before continuing) compared to 
pipeline jobs are durable(Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of your Jenkins controller)
------------Diff b/w scripted and declarative------
by default declarative has scm checkout stage whereas scripted doesnt
declarative have restart from satge as option to restart a build at some satge and scripted doesnt
You can restart any completed Declarative Pipeline from any top-level stage which ran in that Pipeline
Scripted Pipeline - node is a crucial first step as it allocates an executor and workspace for the Pipeline
in declarative you can mention different agent in each stage
the maximum size of the code within the pipeline{} block. This limitation does not apply to Scripted pipelines.

In a multi-branch pipeline, Jenkins automatically  build branches that contain jenkinsfile
Can we reset admin pass if its forgot?
Yes, stop the jenkins and go to cd /var/lib/jenkins and open config.xml file and change useSecurity as false and try to login.
go to configure global security -- security realm - jenkins own user database - anyone can do anythimg

we can trigger upstream and downstream jobs in two ways
1) Under build triggers - build after other projects are built
2) pipeline syntax - declarative directive generator - triggers - upstream - generate declarative - take the snippet and paste in pipeline below agent any

The post section defines one or more additional steps that are run upon the completion of a Pipeline or stage
