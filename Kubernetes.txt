EKS -- managed k8s service by aws, aws manages the control plane (EKS doesnt manage worker nodes)

node -- a node is a machine/server either virtual/physical on which k8s is insatlled

minikube is combination of  apiserver, etcd, scheduler, controller manager, kubelet as exe file

control-plane -- main node which orcehstrates the other worker nodes
in control-plane  it has kube-apiserver(acts as frontend cli/ui/api requests for k8s), etcd(key-value store to store data), 
    controller-manager(brings up nodes when down), kube-scheduler(distributing on which node new pod should be scheduled )	
	
----below should be installed on worker nodes----------
kubelet it is an agent runs on worker nodes, it makes sure containers running on node are as expected
kubeproxy -- for communication b/w nodes and containers
containerruntime which is responsible to run containers Ex: Docker


configMap -- to change small configs say db url we use this inatead of rebuilding whole image again
secret -- reg db username/password in base64 format
------------commands and yaml files below-----------

kubectl get nodes -- to get node details (-o gives full length details of nodes)

pod.yaml
-----kubectl create/apply -f pod.yaml , kubectl get pods, kubectl describe pod nginx
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: mynginx
	type: frontend

spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
     image: nginx
	 
----replicatset -- it will make sure desired pods are in running state, if one pod gets killed it creates another one
kubectl replace -f replicatset.yam or kubectl scale --replcias=6 -f replicaset.yaml -- for changing replicas
apiVersion: apps/	v1 
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: myreplicaset
  labels:
    app: myreplica
	type: frontend

    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
replicas: 3

---------services-----to connect/talk to different services say webserver to redis
